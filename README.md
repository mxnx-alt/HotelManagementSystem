Reception desk for Hotel Management using C language

Only source code "new.c" should be compiled and run
On running the code we get three choices in which we have to select any one of them as per our wish.Based on our choice the code displays the facilities of the Hotel like the type of beds , amenities , etc.Also we can reserve the rooms like type one type two and type three rooms.
